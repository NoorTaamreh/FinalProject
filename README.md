Fake News Detection Using Machine Learning


The rise of fake news has been the subject of several research studies in the last decade. This is due to the increasing number of Internet users and the simplicity of posting news over platforms and websites. Fake news detection for Arabic news has drawn some attention recently. However, the number of such studies is limited due to the lack of datasets that can be used to perform them. This project aims at introducing the first large Arabic fake news corpus ”Arabic Fake News Dataset (AFND)” which was available online in Aprile 2022. I used 2000 articles from credible articles and 2000 from uncredible articles to train the logistic regression model.
The accuracy score of the training data is 0.99 and for the testing data is 0.9675.
